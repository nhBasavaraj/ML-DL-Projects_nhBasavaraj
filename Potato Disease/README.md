i.	The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model using CNN that can accurately identify different types of potato diseases using images of infected plants.

ii.	The model is trained on a dataset of potato plant images, each image labeled with the disease it represents.

iii.	By using CNN and DL techniques, the model is able to recognize specific patterns and symptoms of different diseases with high accuracy.

iv.	The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99.5% to 100% on the test dataset.

v.	The results of this project have the potential to greatly improve potato crop yields by detecting disease outbreaks in early stages which can be a great help for farmers and agricultural industries.

vi.	The model can be used to detect the disease in real-time, which could be useful in preventing further spread of the disease and to take timely action.

vii.	The code and the dataset used in this project are open-sourced and can be accessed from this repository.

viii.	For the code, documentation and additional information, please refer to the [Potato Disease.ipynb](https://github.com/nhBasavaraj/nhBasavaraj/blob/main/Potato%20Disease/DS_DL_Potato_project.ipynb)
