### Project Description:

‚Ä¢	The goal of this project is to develop an image classification system to identify sports celebrities using OpenCV, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The system will be trained on a dataset of images of sports celebrities and will use machine learning algorithms to make predictions on new, unseen images. The famous players used in this project include My favourite Player Virat Kohli, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, and Serena Williams.

‚Ä¢	Pre-processing: Before training the model, the image data will undergo pre-processing to extract relevant features and remove any noise or irrelevant information. One of the key pre-processing steps will be the use of wavelet transform to extract features from the images. This will help to capture important details in the images that will aid in the classification process.

‚Ä¢	Data Cleaning: In addition to the feature extraction, the data will also undergo cleaning to ensure that it is free of any missing or inconsistent values. This will ensure that the model is trained on high-quality data, which will lead to more accurate predictions.

‚Ä¢	Three different machine learning models will be used in this project: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The models will be trained on the pre-processed dataset and their performance will be compared to determine the best model for the task of sports celebrity classification.

‚Ä¢	To further optimize the performance of the models, a Grid Search will be used to perform a hyperparameter tuning. This will involve testing different combinations of parameters for each model to determine the best combination that results in the highest accuracy.

‚Ä¢	The final goal of the project is to find the best model, along with its fine-tuned parameters, that can accurately classify sports celebrities in images.
