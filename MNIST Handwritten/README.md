### Description of an MNIST handwritten project

‚Ä¢	Data acquisition: Load the MNIST dataset using the mnist.load_data() function provided by the Keras library. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

‚Ä¢	Data pre-processing: Pre-process the data by normalizing the pixel values of the images to have zero mean and unit variance. This can be done using the NumPy library. Optionally, we can visualize the pre-processed images using the array_to_img() function provided by the Keras library.

‚Ä¢	Model selection: Choose a model architecture for the task, such as a fully connected neural network. We can use the Sequential class provided by the Keras library to create a feedforward neural network with multiple layers. The number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can be adjusted depending on the complexity of the task.

‚Ä¢	Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to improve model performance. This can be done by adjusting the relevant parameters in the compile() and fit() functions provided by the Keras library.

‚Ä¢	Model training: Train the selected model on the pre-processed training data using the fit() function. Monitor training progress using metrics like training loss and accuracy.

‚Ä¢	Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the test set using the evaluate() function. Calculate metrics like test accuracy and confusion matrix to assess the model's effectiveness.

‚Ä¢	Visualization: Visualize the performance of the model using tools like the confusion matrix plot provided by the confusion_matrix() function of the scikit-learn library.

Overall, this project provides a basic understanding of building and training neural networks for image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset. By adjusting the model architecture, hyperparameters, and pre-processing techniques, we can experiment with different approaches and achieve higher accuracy on the test set.
