### Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Pepper remaining you can delete.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in Browser.

NOTE: ðŸ“Œ If in your local system contains GPU then go for Jupyter Notebook, else Go with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) bcz this project need more computation power so google colab provides free GPU.
